## Ship that app!
Someone else might be able to help you with it.

## The aim
Start the app. Pick an app to ship. Press "Ship it". 

**AppShip** will package up that application, database files, logs, even the installation binaries, zip it all and send it to Starcounter. Normally, for us to diagnose.

## Current status
Clone, build, start the app. Pick an app. Press "Ship it". 

**AppShip** produce a script you can copy to a `.bat` and run. The script will copy all files into a folder. You zip it and hand it to us, using Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
